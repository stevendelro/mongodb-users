# Project 1 of 3: Users - MongoDB Fundamentals
Built while following along: [The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb) by Stephen Grider.

## What does it do?

Nothing. This isn't project that's meant for a user to interface with. 

All of the code from this project is concerned with teaching the student how to properly perform all MongoDB operations with a barrage of examples, explanations and subsequent tests to verify correct input/output.

I added some relevant comments to remind me of key insights throughout the files for personal reference.

## What are some key points that you'd like to make after completing this project?

* Grider uses the first 53% of this entire course (Sections 1-11) on this "users" project. The goal of this project is to show you every single tool that MongoDB has to offer and to show you how they each work through a systematic barrage of Mocha tests.

* This method of teaching *was terrible* for me. Without a project in mind to give context to these tools and operations, I was having so much trouble staying focused, let alone give any lasting meaning to the lessons and tools. 

* **If I’m new to MongoDB and to Mocha testing, I wouldn’t want to learn both at the same time while switching between the two, trying to use one to teach the other.** 

* In the first video of Section 9, Grider *finally* shows us an example of a real-world problem that we would face if we tried to create some sort of blog application with our current database structure. 

* He begins to slowly pivot away from just teaching us the basics, to getting us to think about actually implementing a Mongo database for an actual app. He put us in a situation where we needed to think like a real developer, my ears perked up and my attention had piqued.

* He presented a situation, diagrammed the problem it created, and then took us on a decision making journey of possible solutions to that problem. He then guided us to understand the limits of our current data structure and then formulated a solution that both works within those limits *and* satisfies our UX expectations. 

* We soon went back to the barrage of context-less examples without any over-arching project to complete that could actually give meaning to these lessons. Sigh.


## Final thoughts: 

I hate to be so negative, but man-o-man did I *hate* having to go through that. I could honestly say that I feel nothing more than "exposed" to the utility of MongoDB. After completing the first "project" of this course, I feel exhausted. 

I feel like I didn't retain anything. I feel like I've wasted two days because I don't have the slightest idea on how to implement MongoDB within any of my past apps. I don't know what problems it solves or why it's useful. I just have a bad taste in my mouth about it in general.

The next two "projects" in this course are *actual projects* (I hope), in which we actually make something and finally use MongoDB as a database, and not just a collection of useless tools that we use to pass tests.

I might just take a break from this MongoDB course and begin the Advanced React & Redux course to get my spirits up. I feel as if I lost 100% of my momentum from this users project.

Yeesh.
