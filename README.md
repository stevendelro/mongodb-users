# Project 1 of 3: Users - MongoDB Fundamentals
Built while following along: [The Complete Developers Guide to MongoDB](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-developers-guide-to-mongodb) by Stephen Grider.

## What does it do?


So far, this really isn't an something thats meant for a user to interface with. 

Most of the code from this project is concerned with teaching the student how to properly perform CRUD database operations with a barrage of examples.

## What did building this app teach me?

The course begins at an extremely slow pace. I understand that this is necessary in order to allow complete beginners to gain momentum, but it’s *extremely excruciating*.

I know it’s early in the course, but I’m getting a ton of deprecation errors and Grider makes a few big fumbles with the `done` keyword, one of which led me searching for 20 minutes for where to place a missing `done`. 

I’m hoping things get better as the course progresses. It’s tough to go through remedial content and hit such avoidable roadblocks, but no one is forcing me to do this. This is what I signed up for and I need to stay vigilant.

I’ve got to start another course and segment my time with this one in bite sized chunks. I just finished section 7 and It’s *still* completely dull and boring. Grider is doing a great job teaching, but this particular project is compromised of nothing but exercises, tests, and boring explanations. We aren’t building anything and my mind is wandering *far too much* to be able to power through these relentless lectures, let alone retain any legitimate information.

I see that in Section 12 we finally begin a project, and another on Section 14. I’ll spin this course up again in the morning and hopefully be able to knock out Sections 8-11 quickly and get out of this black hole of a project. 

## Final thoughts: 

 *To be determined*
